Hungry PacMan is a single player arcade game where the player controls the PacMan character and tries to eat
all of PacMan's food while not being caught by enemy ghosts.
The program uses {@link javax.swing.JFrame} to control the graphics of the game. The game runs in several
different states, such as Menu, Game, Rules, and so on. Each state has a different appearance and offers different
options for user interaction. User interacts with the program via mouse and in the Game state via keyboard as well.
The PacMan character is controlled by arrow keys, the four ghosts have different implementation of their movement
each.
